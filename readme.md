# Formide-shared-ui

This is the shared base for all Formide native UIs made with Qt Quick.

It includes the files `main.cpp`, `main.qml`, `formide.js`, `WifiPassword.qml` and `VirtualKeyboard.qml` + all project files.

Fork this repository to create a custom native UI. You will need to create the following complementary pages to have a basic UI:

`Connected.qml`
`NotConnected.qml`
`Connecting.qml`
`Disconnecting.qml`
`Home.qml`
`Wifi.qml`
`Slice.qml`
`StartingPrint.qml`
`Slicing.qml`
`SliceFinished.qml`
`SliceFailed.qml`

Additionally (most likely) you will have to create the rest of the pages, depending on your requests, in order to have a complete UI.
